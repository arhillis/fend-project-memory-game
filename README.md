## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Todo

* Congratulatory Pop-up

    _"When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was."_

* Star rating

    _"The game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display at least 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a even lower star rating (down to 1). __The number of moves needed to change the rating is up to you, but it should happen at some point.__"_

* Timer

    _"When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops."_

* Move Counter

    _"Game displays the current number of moves a user has made. "_

* Responsiveness

    _"All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers. "_
## Functions

Here are the following functions that I have written as part of my function:

### newGame()

This function does exactly what it says it does: starts a new game.
